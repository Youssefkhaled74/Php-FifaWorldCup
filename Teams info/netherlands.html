  <h1>The Netherlands in the World Cup (Pre-2022): A History of Orangebursts</h1>
  <p>The Netherlands has a rich history in the World Cup, marked by periods of dominance, heartbreak, and everything in between. Here's a look at their journey before 2022:</p>

  <h2>Early Success and Missed Opportunities (1930-1974):</h2>
  <p>The Netherlands participated in the inaugural World Cup in 1930, reaching the final but losing to Uruguay.</p>
  <p>They qualified sporadically in the following decades, experiencing first-round exits and near misses.</p>

  <h2>The "Total Football" Era and Golden Generation (1974-1990):</h2>
  <p>This period marked the Netherlands' golden age in World Cups.</p>
  <p>Led by the legendary Johan Cruyff and his revolutionary "Total Football" philosophy, they reached the finals in 1974 and 1978 but fell short both times (lost to West Germany on both occasions).</p>
  <p>They displayed some of the most attractive football ever seen in the World Cup, with iconic players like Ruud Krol, Johan Neeskens, and Rob Rensenbrink.</p>

  <h2>Inconsistent Years (1994-2010):</h2>
  <p>The Netherlands qualified for several World Cups but couldn't replicate their earlier success.</p>
  <p>They reached the semi-finals in 1998, losing to Brazil in a penalty shootout.</p>

  <h2>Resurgence and Third Place (2010-2014):</h2>
  <p>Under the guidance of coach Louis van Gaal, the Netherlands enjoyed a resurgence.</p>
  <p>They finished second in the 2010 World Cup, losing the final to Spain in extra time.</p>
  <p>In 2014, they secured a dominant third-place finish, showcasing a new generation of talent like Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder.</p>

  <h2>Top Scorers (Pre-2022):</h2>
  <p>The Netherlands boasts some legendary World Cup goalscorers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rob Rensenbrink (highest scorer with 6 goals)</li>
    <li>Dennis Bergkamp (5 goals)</li>
    <li>Johan Cruyff (3 goals)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beyond the Statistics:</h2>
  <p>The Netherlands' impact on the World Cup goes beyond results.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Total Football" remains an influential tactical concept, and their attacking style of play continues to inspire.</li>
    <li>Iconic individual moments like Marco van Basten's volley in 1988 are etched in World Cup folklore.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges and Missed Potential:</h2>
  <p>Despite their talent, the Netherlands haven't been able to consistently translate dominance into trophies.</p>
  <p>Internal conflicts and reliance on individual brilliance sometimes hindered their collective performance.</p>

  <h2>Looking Forward:</h2>
  <p>The Netherlands pre-2022 World Cup story is one of brilliance, near misses, and a constant pursuit of the ultimate prize. While they haven't lifted the trophy since 1970, their attacking style and tradition of producing world-class players ensure they remain a force to be reckoned with in future tournaments.</p>
