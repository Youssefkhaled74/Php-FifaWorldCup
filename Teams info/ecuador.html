  </ul>

  <h2>Overall:</h2>

  <h2>Deep Dive into Ecuador's Pre-2022 World Cup Experience</h2>
  <p>Here's some additional information to delve deeper into Ecuador's World Cup history before 2022:</p>

  <h3>The "Home Advantage" Factor:</h3>
  <p>Ecuador's high-altitude home stadium in Quito, nicknamed "La Casa de la Selección" (The House of the National Team), played a strategic role. Opponents struggled to adapt to the thin air, giving Ecuador an edge.</p>

  <h3>Memorable Moments:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Historic Qualification (2002): Defeating powerhouse Brazil 1-0 in Quito secured their first-ever World Cup qualification.</li>
    <li>Upsets and Firsts (2002): Their victory against Croatia marked their debut World Cup win.</li>
    <li>Group Stage Domination (2006): Topping their group with wins against Poland and Costa Rica was a significant feat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenges and Missed Opportunities:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Inconsistent Squad Depth: While they had talented players, relying heavily on a few key individuals sometimes hindered their performance.</li>
    <li>Difficulties Outside High Altitude: Playing in lower altitude environments often evened the playing field for opponents.</li>
    <li>Falling Short in the Knockouts (2006): The narrow loss to England in the Round of 16 left a sense of "what if" for Ecuadorian fans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Looking Forward:</h3>
<p>Ecuador's pre-2022 World Cup experience established them as a force to be reckoned with in South American football. Their ability to qualify for multiple tournaments showed their growth. While they haven't yet replicated their 2006 success, their participationin the 2022 World Cup further solidified their position on the international stage.</p>
