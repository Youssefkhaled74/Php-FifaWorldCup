    <h1>Senegal's Pre-2022 World Cup Journey: A Roar of the Lions</h1>
    <h2>Early Days and Building Identity (Pre-1998):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Senegal participated in their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in 1965, reaching the semi-finals.</li>
        <li>The following decades saw them qualify for AFCON sporadically, showcasing flashes of potential but failing to consistently challenge for the title.</li>
        <li>Football emerged as a unifying force in the nation, with "Les Lions de la Teranga" (The Lions of Teranga) becoming a symbol of national pride.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Golden Generation and World Cup Debut (1998-2002):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The late 1990s saw the rise of a talented generation of Senegalese players, including Khalilou Fadiga, El Hadji Diouf, and Papa Bouba Diop.</li>
        <li>They qualified for their first World Cup in 2002, a historic moment for Senegalese football.</li>
        <li>At the World Cup, they surprised the world, defeating reigning champions France in the opening match.</li>
        <li>They reached the quarter-finals, becoming the first West African nation to achieve that feat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Years of Promise and Missed Opportunities (2002-2018):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Despite the 2002 success, Senegal struggled to replicate it in subsequent years.</li>
        <li>They came close to qualifying for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups but fell short in the final stages.</li>
        <li>They reached the AFCON finals twice (2002 and 2019) but lost on both occasions, experiencing heartbreak.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Return to the World Stage and AFCON Glory (2018-2021):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Under coach Aliou Ciss√©, a former player from the 2002 generation, Senegal experienced a resurgence.</li>
        <li>They qualified for the 2018 World Cup, showcasing a new blend of experience and youthful talent.</li>
        <li>While they exited in the group stage, their performance displayed their potential.</li>
        <li>The turning point came in 2021 when they finally lifted the AFCON trophy, defeating Egypt on penalties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beyond the Scoresheet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Senegal's journey is more than just results.</li>
        <li>Their passionate playing style, exemplified by their nickname "Les Lions de la Teranga" (The Lions of Hospitality), resonates with fans worldwide.</li>
        <li>The team serves as a source of national unity and inspiration for young Senegalese footballers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Looking Forward:</h2>
    <p>Senegal's pre-2022 World Cup experience is one of steady growth, heartbreaking misses, and finally, continental glory. With a talented squad and a passionate following, they positioned themselves as a force to be reckoned with in future World Cups. Their 2022 appearance was another step in their journey to establish themselves as a major player on the world stage.</p>
